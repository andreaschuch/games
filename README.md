# About this project
In this project, I'm implementing games such as TicTacToe in python. I have worked on the following functionalities:
- GUI-based interaction allowing users to play the game
- automizated players allowing users to play against a machine player 
- training and evaluation of machine-learning based automized players.

For more details regarding the current state, please generate the doxygen documentation (see below).
